        <h1>When will Jeff Play Jonah?</h1>
        <h2>Jeff, the back to back Madden Fantasy Franchise Superbowl champion, has kept pushing back his user game versus Jonah, busy or ducking?</h2>
        <p>The Madden Fantasy Franchise league is in its most nerve racking and exciting time, the playoffs. Through the nerves all the teams are feeling in the Divisional Championship round, there is one team that seems to be scared out of the minds. Leading the dominant superteam, the Dallas Cowboys, is Jeff, who has won the last 2 Superbowls in a row; Even with this hot streak, Jeff has simply refused to play his user game versus the Jonah led Detroit Lions, repeatedly pushing the game's date back day after day. Jeff seems to wildly intimidated by Jonah's airing out abilities and is hiding like a coward to delay what I think is the inevitable - a Detroit Lion's victory.</p>
