        <h1>Madden Franchise Playoffs in Full Force!</h1>
        <h2>The Madden 23 Franchise League has begun season 3's playoff runs, read more about it here.</h1>
        <p>The playoffs are here and the teams are coming in full swing! The current KeksD contenders are: the feeder, Abe - the back to back Jeff - shallow cross air out machine, Jonah and Tracey Torrence relier, Blair. The teams who were unable to make the playoffs are: "I'm tanking", Sean - career destroyer, Dean - and Leonard Fournette owner, Jamie. In both past seasons the Dallas Cowboys led by Jeff have taken the championship with a team led by Desmond Ridder, DK Metcalf and TJ Watt. Facing him in the NFC is a defense legend, Jonah, his team is led by Kyler Murray and Amon-ra Saint Brown. On the opposite side of the league there is the previous year's Superbowl loser, Blair with a team featuring Red Batch, Tony Poggard and Chase Young, facing the early game interception thrower, Abe who will be looking for the Justin Jefferson/Alphonso Billips and Parker Spears connection. Will Jonah, Abe and Blair be able to compete with Jeff's team and abilities? Come back soon to find out the results!</p>
