        <h1>Chris, a rust enjoyer or addict?</h1>
        <h2>Whenever you see Chris, he is either working or playing Rust, is this new found love for the game an enjoyable pass time or an addiction?</h1>
        <p>Chris is very famous among the KeksD group, being known as a toxic, dedicated and skilled gamer; He has recently picked up Rust, a multiplayer survival game where you compete with other players for resources, build bases, protect your base from players and decay as well as raid other people's bases. On paper the game is supposed to be a fun experience with friends, but has Chris taken it a step too far? Recenly whenever Chris is playing video games, he is playing Rust, whenever he is hanging out with friends  he enjoys talking about Rust and trying to recruit people to play Rust. Is this just a temporary obsession, a good way to pass time during the cold winter time or an addiction? I personally think its the latter, I will update this article as time goes on and my observation and study of the situation continues.</p>
