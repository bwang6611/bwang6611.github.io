        <h1>Top 3 BIGGEST Breakout Potentials in 2023</h1>
        <h2>Welcome back everyone and happy New Years! This is a list of my top 3 biggest breakout potential Valorant players in the 2023 year.</h1>
        <h3>#1. Sean</h3>
        <p>Sean had a bit of a down patch at the end of the year, but that can be forgiven with the cold weather that has been looming. Throughout the entire year Sean has proved to be a vital part of the team, having many games showcasing his potential as well as picking up new agents throughout the year and making them look like his OTP. Keep a lookout for Sean this year!</p>
        <h3>#2. Jeff</h3>
        <p>This is no big suprise, as Jeff has been SKYROCKETING through the rankings throughout the past year, in the later parts of 2022 it was obvious Jeff had developed heavily and taken advantage of his natural fragging abilities and high game knowledge to become an essential part of the squad. KEEP A CLOSE EYE OUT for Jeff in 2023 as he could be a league winning pick in the early-late 2nd round</p>
        <h3>#3. Xander</h3>
        <p>Alright, I will admit it, this one is a bit of a reach. With Xander's toxic attitude and hatred towards the game, many people will be outraged that he has made this list. However, with his innate first-person IQ, godlike head tapping and spray control, clear cut commuication and natural leadership abilities, currently sitting at a late 9th round pick in standard 12 man leagues Xander could become THE league winner in 2023 with top fragger potential, make sure to follow his progress through the 2023 year</p>
