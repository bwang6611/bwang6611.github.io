        <h1>The Jets Win!</h1>
        <h2>After an outstanding win, Abe's team, the New York Jets, advance to the Superbowl!</h2>
        <p>The New York Jets suffered a crushing loss versus the Los Vegas Raiders in the 2024 Conference round in the Madden 23 Fantasy Franchise League; But Jet's head coach Abe did not let that discourage him, defeating the Blair led Raiders in a rematch in the Divisional Championships. This was no ordinary victory, as after 2 great defensive plays, forcing 2 interceptions 1 returned for a defensive touchdown, Blair rage quit and uninstalled the game - causing an immediate win by default. I got the chance to interview some of the Jet's players after the game, asking how they felt about such a dominant win. Wide Receiver Justin Jefferson, who ended the game with 0 targets, 0 catches for 0 yards said: "I love this team and the head coach, I'm also estatic about getting back to the Superbowl, I just wish Abe gave me more of a chance to make an impact. Still, great win, FLY HIGH JETS". Middle Linebacker Roquon Smith who returned a crucial interception for a touchdown said: "I just make the plays I can man, keep an eye out for me in the Superbowl". Congratulations to the Jets and good luck in the Superbowl, come back later for updates!</p>
