        <h1>Who's Fault is it?</h1>
        <h2>Dean has clearly been struggling to defeat any user or AI in the Madden 23 Fantasy Franchise league, he seems to believe his players are playing at an underwhelming level, but it is really their fault? Here's my take on the situation</h1>
        <p>Dean, a self proclaimed "good" Madden player, has been losing a lot of games, almost equalling his brother, Sean's, record; However, Sean is tanking on purpose for draft pick and Dean is trying to win. Dean has put a lot of blame on his players in these past weeks, here is a quote from him "my cornerstone is hasan reddick
            thats it", but is can all of the fault really be put on his team's players only? Madden 23 Franchise is a gamemode in the well known American football video game created by EA Games, in this franchise you can play as a head coach and create, upgrade and control your team; It has been known for bad players to play poorly, wide receivers dropping wide open passes, quarterbacks throwing the ball inaccurately randomly to defenders, defenders missing tackles or being dribbled like a basketball, etc. so there is some claim that Dean's players could be bad. However, in my eyes, Dean is just dogshit at the game, and I have two examples of why I think that. First of all, Dean claimed initially that his bad quarterback play, Trey Lance, was at fault for losing his games, after Trey Lance was traded away he has since become a top 5 quarterback in the franchise league; This leads me to believe that Dean, the head coach, was simply trying to destroy Lance's career with bad coaching, playmaking and reads. The second example is Dean's actual team composition, as previously quoted in the article Dean mentioned that only Hasan Redick, linebacker, was a cornerstone on his team; But taking another look at this squad, I notcied he has Jamar Chase, top 3 wide receiver in the franchise league on his team, this leads me to believe that, if not even Jamar can take over Dean's games, it is all the fault of Deans, not his teams.</p>
