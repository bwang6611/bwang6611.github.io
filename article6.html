        <h1>The Hypocrisy of fw1z-NEWPORT</h1>
        <p>CSGO (Counter-Strike Global Offensive) is one of the most popular FPS (first person shooter) games played worldwide today, a game that not only has immersive gunplay but also a nostalgia effect. Released in August 21, 2012, it has been a staple of FPS enjoyers through their childhood to their current age today. Player counts have shown that CSGO has reached their top number of average players in April 2020, having 1,305,714 players online and playing the game at their peak. Over a decade since release, new FPS games have come out to challenge the monopoly that CSGO seemed to have, the main game seeming to be Valorant. 
            Released in June 20, 2020, Valorant is a FPS game released by MOBA giant Riot Games who created League of Legends, one of the top played games in the world. Branching out into the FPS scene, many CSGO players quickly went to see whether Valorant could even meet the standards that they were accustomed to. Self-proclaimed CSGO main fw1z-NEWPORT- (Alexander Quezada), a loyal player to CSGO was one of these players. At first glance, he was entirely against Valorant even quoted saying, “It feels like you’re running through mud”. He continued this abhorrence of Valorant, even going as far as defaming the creators of the game and saying questionable racial remarks of the company, alluding to a deal that was done with TenCent and Riot in which Riot Games was acquired by TenCent a mobile gaming giant in China. While those remarks were taken back and fw1z is rumored to be saying racial remarks continuously. 
            With all these remarks and seeming hatred for the game, one would have expected this loyal CSGO player to avoid any instances of this game. Many reports have been collected that show fw1z to actually be playing Valorant and not only on one instance, but multiple. Queuing in parties of 5 or even 3, there have been screenshots taken that indicate that fw1z has been playing consistently enough to even gain a rank, something that is only able to be done after playing the initial placement games. Additionally, some of those close to fw1z have heard him talking about the lore of Valorant, even knowing much more about the characters in the game in contrast to those who he berates for playing the game. It is obvious that fw1z loves FPS games and while claiming to be a CSGO main, he has spent an awful amount of time playing the very game he has been very against. 
            The investigation continues as fanbases are confused as to whether fw1z-NEWPORT- will continue with his charade for his hatred of Valorant or if he will finally come to terms and start playing seriously. The question remains and it is only one that fw1z-NEWPORT- can answer.
